# Big Data In CyberSecruity

# Description about this project 
I did this project for my big data programming class as a graduate student 
It contains a documentation folder that shows my presentation file which goes over the overview of big data programming , including code and visualization.
It also contains the code folder which contains the code file coded in jupyter notebook source code editor using the language python. 
There is also a csv file in the code section which is the dataset we used to show how big data is used in cybersecruity

# Directions to access the code 
The code was coded in juypter notebook which is the source code editor that I recommended to use to run the code , but other editors can be used as well such as: R studio, visual studio code, Atom, and Pycharm. 
 # Steps to access the code: 
 1. Download as a zip folder 
 2. Extract the zip folder into your local computer 
 3. Make sure to have the code file and csv file in the same directory 
 4. If using jupyter notebook click the code file once connected to jupyter notebook than run the code.
